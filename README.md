# Project Week 5 Lyndsey & Thomas

## MongoDB


## User Story
As a DEVELOPER I need to USE A MONGO DATABASE IN MY PROJECT so that I CAN SHOW MY UNDERSTANDING OF HOW TO SET UP AND USE A DATABASE

- [ ]  App uses the Mongo driver
- [ ]  App uses one or more collections to store and retrieve data

As a DEVELOPER I need to STORE MY QUERIES IN A SENSIBLE WAY so that I CAN KEEP MY APP ORGANISED

- [ ]  Queries are organised in a consistent way
- [ ]  Queries are kept separate from handler functions
 
As a DEVELOPER I need to SORT DATA USING MONGODB so that I CAN DEVELOP MY UNDERSTANDING OF HOW MONGO SORTS DATA

- [ ]  Queries include some sorting of data

As a DEVELOPER I need to VALIDATE DATABASE ENTRIES USING JOI so that I CAN DEMONSTRATE MY UNDERSTANDING OF VALIDATION BY SCHEMA

- [ ]  Data is validated before it is inserted into the database
- [ ]  One or more schemas are used

As a DEVELOPER I need to WRITE TESTS FOR MY DATABASE QUERIES so that I KNOW THAT THEY WORK AS EXPECTED

- [ ]  Each query has associated tests
- [ ]  Test files / functions are organised sensibly
- [ ]  A test database is erased and populated at the start of each test run

From last week, you still need to fully meet:

AS a USER I need to GET USEFUL FEEDBACK IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG so that I CAN CHANGE MY INPUT

- [ ]  I get a warning message if something goes wrong on the server
- [ ]  I am told clearly what I need to change

AS a USER I need to ACCESS THE SITE EQUALLY WELL USING A SCREEN READER so that I CAN ACCESS THE PAGE WITH A VISUAL IMPAIRMENT

- [ ]  the page can be read using VoiceOver
- [ ]  any forms, buttons, images and links are accessible
